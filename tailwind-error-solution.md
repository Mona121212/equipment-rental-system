# 🛠️ Issue Log: `npx tailwindcss` Error — "could not determine executable to run"

## 📌 Problem Description

While running the following command in my project directory:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -v
```

I encountered this error:

```
npm error could not determine executable to run
npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_logs\...
```

Even though tailwindcss was installed as a dev dependency, the CLI wouldn't work.

## 🖥️ System Information

- **OS**: Windows 11  
- **Node.js**: v22.17.0 (installed via nvm-windows)  
- **npm**: v10.9.2  
- **Tailwind CSS**: 4.1.11  
- **Project path**: `D:\my-portfolio\equipment-rental-system`  

## 🔍 Root Cause

Starting from **Tailwind CSS v4**, the CLI tool was moved into a separate package: `@tailwindcss/cli`.

When using `npx tailwindcss`, npm couldn’t locate an executable (binary) for `tailwindcss` inside the main package, leading to this error:

> could not determine executable to run

## 🧪 Debugging Attempts

### Initial install:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss -v
```
❌ Error: could not determine executable to run

### Tried global install:

```bash
npm install -g tailwindcss
tailwindcss -v
```
❌ Error: 'tailwindcss' is not recognized as a command

### Checked system PATH:

Ensured that the npm global path:

```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm
```
was included in the system environment variables.

Still, `tailwindcss.cmd` was missing.

## ✅ Final Solution

### Uninstall incorrect packages:

```bash
npm uninstall tailwindcss
```

### Install the correct packages:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @tailwindcss/cli
```

### Run again:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -v
```
✅ CLI version displayed correctly.

## 💡 Summary

This issue was caused by a breaking change in Tailwind CSS v4, where the CLI was split into a separate package.

Fixing it required careful inspection of:

- Log files
- PATH settings
- Package version differences

I resolved the issue by installing `@tailwindcss/cli`, enabling CLI usage via `npx`.

This experience improved my understanding of Node.js tooling and version-specific changes in frontend libraries.
